  <h3 style=" padding-left: 2%;" class="left st">“The person riding has no empathy for the person walking. It is the same for a full person and a starving person.”</h3>
  <p class="sz big">
    <span class="font">
      It was a very hot summer day in the desert, and there was a man who was riding a camel on the desert road. The camel was slowly walking and the man really wanted to get to the city as soon as possible, but the city was far away. The man on the
      camel was riding until he reached a hill and saw a man walking. The man that was walking was very tired and he couldn’t move another inch. Then the camel rider came to the man walking and said,“ Hey brother, how are you doing?” The walker said
      to the camel rider “I am tired and my legs and arms are very sore.” The camel rider saw that the walker had a beautiful back pack, then the camel rider said, “Sell your back pack and buy a cripple donkey, so you can travel without getting so
      tired.” The walker said “This pack is my business, I can't sell it. I go to different places and I sell things that are in my pack.” Then the walker said to the camel rider “You and I are from the same city. Can I ride on your camel back to our
      city?” The camel rider replied, “This camel is my baby, he can only carry one person.” Camel rider left the walker all alone. The walker started walking and after some time he became hungry and took some bread and date out of his pack and he
      ate while he was walking. Now, the camel rider became hungry and sat on the desert floor. The walker reached the camel rider and asked him how he was doing. The camel rider said, “I’m very hungry and I have no energy in my arms and legs.” He
      then said, “ We are from the same city, please give me some food”. The walker replied, “I only have enough food for one person”. He then said, “sell your camel and get food with the money”. The camel rider smiled and said “I can’t this Camel is
      very dear to me”.

      Meanwhile, the families of both the rider and the walker were waiting in the city for them. They were surprised when they saw a camel with no rider came to them and kneel beside them. They then sent help and first found the man walking laying
      on the ground tired. They helped him up on their camel. They then went on and found the man who had the camel. He too was tired and was laying on the ground. They also helped him up on the camel and with both men at their side went to town.
      After everyone was fine, the two men’s families were all together. The camel rider asked the walker “Why didn’t you give me food when I asked? I was really hungry”. The Walker smiled and said, “Why didn’t you let me on your camel? I was really
      tired”. They all laughed and said:

      “The person riding has no empathy for the person walking. It is the same for a full person and a starving person.”
